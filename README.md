üè• Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

This repository contains an interactive Power BI project analyzing hospital emergency room data.
The dashboard provides insights into patient admissions, demographics, wait times, satisfaction, and departmental referrals to improve hospital performance and patient care.

üìä Project Overview

The dashboard is divided into four major analytical sections:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Monthly View
‚Ä¢	Tracks monthly patient volume, average wait times, satisfaction scores, and referrals.
‚Ä¢	Admission vs non-admission status analysis.
‚Ä¢	Patient demographics by age, gender, and race.
‚Ä¢	Percentage of patients seen within the target wait time (30 minutes).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Consolidated View
‚Ä¢	Aggregated data across multiple months (Jan‚ÄìJul 2024).
‚Ä¢	Overall admission status: ~50% admitted vs 50% non-admitted.
‚Ä¢	Department referrals with highest cases: General Practice, Orthopedics, Physiotherapy, and Cardiology.
‚Ä¢	Gender distribution (male vs female nearly balanced).
‚Ä¢	Race distribution: White, African American, Asian, Multi-racial, and others.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Patient Details
‚Ä¢	Individual-level records with patient ID, demographics, wait times, admission status, and referral departments.
‚Ä¢	Enables detailed analysis of admission trends and satisfaction correlations.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Takeaways
‚Ä¢	Total Patients (19 months): 9,216 unique cases.
‚Ä¢	Avg Wait Time: ~35 minutes (above ideal threshold).
‚Ä¢	Avg Satisfaction Score: 4.99 / 10 ‚Üí highlights service improvement needs.
‚Ä¢	Department Referrals:
o	None: 5,400 cases
o	General Practice: 1,840 cases
